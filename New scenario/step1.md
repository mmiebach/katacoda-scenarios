First you need to clone the My Thai Star repository.
Run `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star.git`{{execute}}

Now you need to switch to the folder you just created.
`cd my-thai-star`{{execute}}

After that, you can build and run the application.
Run `docker-compose up`{{execute}}

This will take some time.
